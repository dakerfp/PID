This is a simple and easy PID controller written in C++ to be used on any plataform! Including embedded microcontrollers!

This features:
	-High abstract object oriented code. For quickly use.
	-Trapezoidal integrator. Much more accurate then normal Euler integrators.
	-Optional error threshold to be use with hysteresis loops.
	-Configurable upper and lower output saturation values.
	-Integrator with windup protection.


All the necessary documentation is written above each function on the .hpp file.
Please, if you have some trouble using it, send me a message!
